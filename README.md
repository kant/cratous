## Installation Guide

### Requirement installation

(This was tested on an Ubuntu 32 bit system)

1. Install [UxAS](https://github.com/afrl-rq/OpenUxAS) and verify it is running correctly.
2. Switch to the ```ICAROUS_integration``` branch of UxAS and recompile UxAS.
3. Install [ICAROUS](https://github.com/nasa/icarous) and verify it is running correctly.
4. Switch ICAROUS over to this fork:
```
git remote add cratous_branch git:https://github.com/winstontssmith/icarous
git fetch cratous_branch
git pull cratous_branch master
```


### CRATOUS Installation
1. Pull cratous into `icarous/cFS/` relative to your ICAROUS installation with:
    ```git pull github.com/nasa/cratous```
2. Rebuild icarous from the top folder (icarous):

```
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make -j9 cpu1-install
```

3. At this point it should be good to run. To test, run the examples found in `OpenUxAS/example/07_.../`. The file `runDemo.sh` in each of these should run the example without any other input.
Note: You may need to set the value in `/proc/sys/fs/mqueue/max_msg` to `1000` so that ICAROUS can run without `sudo`.
